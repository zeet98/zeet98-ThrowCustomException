     * This method should throw a CustomException. CustomException is a custom exception that we've written ourselves
     * by extending the Exception class in CustomException.java. In a large scale application, writing custom
     * exceptions could provide valuable information for when something goes wrong in the application. For instance,
     * if the development of a new method would require a FileNotFoundException to be thrown in a certain situation,
     * the line throw new FileNotFoundException();
     *
     * You will need to add a 'throws CustomException' declaration to this method, and throw a new CustomException
     * within this method.
     *
     * This also means that you should NOT write a try/catch block in this method, as the tests are expecting to have
     * a method thrown to it. A try/catch block would handle the exception within the method. The tests, on the other
     * hand, are using a try/catch block to catch the exception thrown by this method.
